Walkthrough: Enterprise AI Multimedia Workspace
I have successfully implemented the "Chat Console + Media Gallery" workspace as requested.

Features Implemented
Split-Screen Layout:

Left panel: Chat Console (30% default width, resizable).
Right panel: Media Gallery (70% default width).
Uses react-resizable-panels for smooth dragging.
Chat Console:

Displays chat history with distinct user/assistant styles.
Input area with "Context File" tags support.
Sends messages to the API (currently simulated with mock data).
Media Gallery:

Grid view of media assets (Images, Videos, PDFs).
Assets are generated based on keywords in the chat (e.g., "report", "image", "video").
Asset Card: Shows thumbnail/icon and filename. Hover actions for Preview, Ask AI, Download.
Universal Previewer:

Full-screen overlay to preview files.
Supports Image, Video, and PDF (via iframe/native).
Download button included.
"Ask AI" Context:

Clicking "Ask AI" on an asset adds it as a tag to the chat input.
Allows context-aware questioning (simulated).
Technical Details
Stack: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
State Management: Zustand (useWorkspaceStore).
Styling: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn-like utility classes.
API: 
src/lib/api.ts
 contains the logic. Currently uses a mock generator to simulate Coze API streaming and asset return. The real fetchEventSource code is present but commented out until valid keys are provided.
How to Run
Navigate to the project directory:
cd wenquchat-web
Install dependencies (if not already done):
npm install

Preview: Click on any asset card to open the preview.
Context: Click the "Message" icon on an asset card to add it to the input.
